# TLAVisualizer
This is a work-in-progress tool to visualise system specification models written in TLA+. The tool also allows navigating through system - i.e. at each state, the tool shows possible next states, and actions available. The user can trigger an event, which should move the system to one of its next states.

## How to run the tool in Eclipse
1. Make sure you have Eclipse installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Import the project to your Eclipse workspace.
4. Run the tlavisaulser
